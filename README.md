## 🚀 Usage

Make sure you have [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) installed (`npx` is shipped by default since npm `5.2.0`)

Just run the following command at the root of your project and answer questions:

```sh
npx readme-md-generator
```

Or use default values for all questions (`-y`):

```sh
npx readme-md-generator -y
```

Use your own `ejs` README template (`-p`):

```sh
npx readme-md-generator -p path/to/my/own/template.md
```

You can find [ejs README template examples here](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator/tree/master/templates).
