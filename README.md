<h1 align="center">Welcome to User Management Web Application 👋</h1>

## Functionality of the application

The application helps manage user information, with features to add, edit, delete, and view users. The application has authorization and authentication, and only users with the Admin role can access the application.

## ✨ Demo

On the Login screen, you can enter your account information to log into the application. If your account is disabled, please contact the Admin to activate your account. With the Remember me button, you do not need to log in to your account on subsequent visits.

## 🚀 Usage

Make sure you have [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) installed (`npx` is shipped by default since npm `5.2.0`)

Just run the following command at the root of your project and answer questions:

```sh
npx readme-md-generator
```

Or use default values for all questions (`-y`):

```sh
npx readme-md-generator -y
```

Use your own `ejs` README template (`-p`):

```sh
npx readme-md-generator -p path/to/my/own/template.md
```

You can find [ejs README template examples here](https://github.com/kefranabg/readme-md-generator/tree/master/templates).
